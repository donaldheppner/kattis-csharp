# How To Use
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), the script used to submit answers is supplied by Kattis and is written in Python.  You may also need to install the requests library: ```pip install requests```
2. Configure the [Kattis submit client](https://open.kattis.com/help/submit) by downloading your personal configuration file as described [here](https://open.kattis.com/help/submit).
3. Run ```init.bat <problem_name>``` to download the problem & test data, clone the starting solution, and launch Visual Studio.
4. Once you have a working solution, navigate to the problem folder and run ```submit.bat```.

If you are using the library in a competition and submitting to a specific URL, update ```init.bat```

Test it out on an easy problem, try ```init carrots``` to start [Solving for Carrots](https://open.kattis.com/problems/carrots).
